# Otonagai-dl

[**Otonagai**](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/otonagai/)(大人買い）is a word used to describe people (mostly adults) who spend money on products marketed towards children (like gunpla, action figures, but we all know that).

Otonagai-dl is a CLI-based app that keeps track of your favourite merchandise from anime/video games/ manga/ comic books using product data from HobbylinkJapan.

Originally, this was being made to keep track of build progress of gunpla (Gundam Model Kits), but I thought it would be better to expand it to action figures and other merch available.
