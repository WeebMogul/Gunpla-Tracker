Things to do:

- Load up database
- Decide on basic features:
    -- Search
    -- Update
    -- Delete
- Create separate table for build status : Acquired, Building, Completed
    - 3 states : Yellow (In Process), Green (Completed), Red (Stopped) by default
    - All entries will be empty unless done
- Create database for logs : 
    - ID, Name
    - Comment
    - ID is duplicate as foreign key
